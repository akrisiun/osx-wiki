7-inch-touch for RPi 2

http://blog.tpcware.com/2015/05/a-nice-7-inch-touch-display-for-windows-10-raspberry-pi-2/

Too good to be true, I can develop Universal apps for my Raspberry Pi 2 on my narrow work space, and have it right to my PC J.

The juice

You can buy it from Amazon or directly from Sain Smart.
It’s a kit consisting of:

HDMI+VGA+2AV Controller Board VS-TY2662-V1 (Support Automatically switch to AV2 )
7 inch 800* 480 Lcd Panel AT070TN92 with Touch Screen
USB Controller Card
USB Cable
The control board drives the display, and you’ll attach the Raspberry HDMI output to the control board.
 This way you don’t need to install a driver, the kit act as a HDMI TV.

Follow the video instructions and be sure to use a 12 DCV power supply with positive polarity (+) inside and 
negative polarity (-) outside.

I still need to experiment a little more to say if touch works (more in another post that I’ll write shortly).

Make. Invent. Do.

With many thanks to Microsoft and all the IoT team!
